Clay 0.1.0
==========

Platform support
----------------
Linux and MacOS X hosts and targets should work out of the box. FreeBSD mostly
works, but some tests fail due to minor platform differences Clay doesn't
account for. Win32 targeting the MSVC toolchain mostly works, but has some
problems due to LLVM 3.0 bugs on the platform. Win64, Mingw, and Cygwin targets
are untested.

Known issues
------------
#17 - emacs clay-mode does not properly indent braces.
#36 - A single static value can still match a tuple pattern.
#60 - Assertions and unhandled exception errors do not support backtrace display
    on Windows or FreeBSD.
#117 - The compiler does not prevent unsupported types, such as Int128 on 32-bit
    platforms or Float80 on non-x86 platforms, from being instantiated, leaving
    LLVM to fail hard when these types are used.
#123 - Parse time is excessively slow on Windows XP due to bad memory allocation
    behavior.
#144 - LLVM does not 16-byte-align the stack for FreeBSD targets, causing
    external functions that pass vector arguments by value to crash.
#145 - FreeBSD's printf does not format "%La" arguments in the manner expected
    by some Clay code.
#146 - The `io.sockets` library fails to compile on FreeBSD due to a system
    type mismatch.
#153, #178 - The `math` module is still a work in progress and largely
    untested.
#156 - The compile-time evaluator is not endian-agnostic when cross building.
#165, #166 - LLVM bugs cause overflow-checking multiplication and unsigned-to-
    floating-point conversion to fail on Windows.
