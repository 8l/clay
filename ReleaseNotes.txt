Clay 0.1.1
==========

This is a bugfix release. All Clay 0.1.0 source code should be source-compatible.

Platform support
----------------
Linux, MacOS X, Win32, Win64, FreeBSD hosts and targets should work out of the box,
with some expected test failures for Win64 and FreeBSD.
Windows with the MSVC toolchain is known to work, but Mingw, and Cygwin targets
are untested.

Known issues
------------
#17 - emacs clay-mode does not properly indent braces.
#36 - A single static value can still match a tuple pattern.
#60 - Assertions and unhandled exception errors do not support backtrace display
    on Windows or FreeBSD.
#117 - The compiler does not prevent unsupported types, such as Int128 on 32-bit
    platforms or Float80 on non-x86 platforms, from being instantiated, leaving
    LLVM to fail hard when these types are used.
#123 - Parse time is excessively slow on Windows XP due to bad memory allocation
    behavior.
#144 - LLVM does not 16-byte-align the stack for FreeBSD targets, causing
    external functions that pass vector arguments by value to crash.
#153, #178 - The `math` module is still a work in progress and largely
    untested.
#156 - The compile-time evaluator is not endian-agnostic when cross building.
#164 - Lack of runtime support on Win32 causes overflow-checking multiplication
    and Int128 operations to fail on Windows targets.
