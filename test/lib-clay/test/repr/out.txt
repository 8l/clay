    -- FAILED
  in expectEqualValues:
    `'\x12', "x\t"` are expected to equal:
      '\r', "x\t"
    but are:
      '\x12', "x\t"
    -- FAILED
  in expectIterator and expectSequence:
    `iterator(vs)` is expected to contain:
      4u
    but contains:
      1u
      17u

    `vs` is expected to contain:
      12u
